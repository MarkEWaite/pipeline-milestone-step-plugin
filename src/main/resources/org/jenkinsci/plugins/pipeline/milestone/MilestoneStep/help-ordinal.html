    An optional ordinal for the milestone. It is autogenerated if not explicitly set.

<p>
    Setting explicit milestone ordinals grants that each milestone can be univocally identified across builds
    even when editions of the script happen in the middle. If you plan to add/remove milestone steps while there are
    running builds and trigger new builds brefore the previous ones finished, then you should set explicit milestone ordinals.
    Otherwise, let the step autogenerate them as it runs.
